# Space Eater

This is an app you can build and install on an iOS device to help _**eat**_ up disk space. Why would you want to do that? Well, for those times when you want to verify how the app you are developing or debugging behaves under conditions of low disk space. 

* Keep in mind that once you get the disk close to being full you may not have enough to install the app you are trying to debug from Xcode. Use the _Delete One File_ action until you are able to install the app and then use the _Generate Files_ action again to fill up more space.
* Also keep in mind many disk caching mechanism your app might be using will tend to clean up when the app is put into the background or terminated, so your results will vary.
* Debugging disk space related issues is hard, so use this tool to help your efforts but don't expect it to magically find your issues on its own.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**
If everything is not working on the device as expected there is a chance you may brick it. I've not seen that happen, but please be forewarned.
